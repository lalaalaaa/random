# WPS PDF Combine

## Summary
This combines the intro letter and completion certificated for WPS reports.

## How to use
Download, unzip and move to ~/Library/Services.

- Select the PDFs to combine. Note: the Intro Letter must end in "Report.pdf" (this is silly and hacky for now)
- Right-click, choose Services > Combine PDFs
- The Service will save the new PDF to the Desktop.
